# Language Learning Platform
AI-powered vocabulary learning platform that auto-populates customizable notes with definitions, examples, and context - so learners can focus on understanding instead of manual data entry.

## Problem
Manually creating vocabulary notes takes 10-15 minutes per word. Current tools require learners to find examples, write definitions, and identify related words themselves - creating friction that discourages learning.

## Solution
Search any word → get pre-populated card with definitions, examples, related words, and patterns → add personal insights → save to your knowledge base.
**90% automation, 10% personalization.**

## Key Features
- 📚 Personal knowledge base with linking and tags
- 🤖 Auto-populated vocabulary cards with NLP
- 💬 LLM assistant for nuance questions
- 📝 Spaced repetition review system

## Target Users
Intermediate language learners (B1-B2) consuming authentic content who want depth over breadth.

## Project Status
🚧 In Development - Currently in planning/MVP phase
